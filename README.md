# HP25-Bundle: Decentralized Microlending Platform

A revolutionary microlending platform that combines intelligent loan bundling, advanced risk assessment, and a modern mobile interface for efficient microloan management.

## Vision & Overview

HP25-Bundle revolutionizes microlending by:
- Creating an efficient marketplace for small loans
- Enabling intelligent loan bundling for improved management
- Providing sophisticated risk assessment and resource allocation
- Empowering borrowers in developing economies while offering investors new opportunities
- Maintaining transparency while ensuring benefits flow to underserved communities

## Core Features

### For Borrowers
- Secure loan application submission
- Transparent risk assessment and interest rates
- Real-time application status tracking
- Flexible payment schedules

### For Investors
- Access to tokenized microloan bundles
- Diversified investment opportunities
- Real-time portfolio management
- Blockchain-based security trading

## Project Components

### 1. Loan Bundling System (`/loan_bundling`)
- Firebase-based loan management
- Real-time bundle creation and tracking
- Firestore database integration
- Bundle status management
- Automated loan status updates

### 2. Risk Assessment Engine (`/RiskModelandAPI`)
#### Risk Scoring Parameters
- Essential Parameters (e.g., funded_amount, sector, location)
- Recommended Parameters (e.g., borrower demographics, payment history)
- Optional Parameters (e.g., geographical data, exchange rates)
- Bundle-specific Parameters (for aggregated risk assessment)

#### Risk Score System
The risk assessment model uses an advanced XGBoost regressor that outputs scores on a 0-100 scale:

##### Risk Score Interpretation
- 90-100: Excellent (Very Low Risk)
  - Historical pattern of full repayment
  - Strongest creditworthiness indicators
  - Ideal for bundling as anchor loans

- 75-89: Good (Low Risk)
  - Strong repayment probability
  - Favorable risk indicators
  - Reliable bundle components

- 60-74: Moderate (Average Risk)
  - Acceptable repayment probability
  - Some risk factors present
  - Suitable for diversified bundles

- 40-59: Caution (High Risk)
  - Elevated default probability
  - Multiple risk factors
  - Requires risk mitigation strategies

- 0-39: High Caution (Very High Risk)
  - Significant default probability
  - Major risk factors present
  - Not recommended for standard bundles

##### Score Calculation Factors
- Sector performance history
- Geographic risk assessment
- Loan amount evaluation
- Currency stability factors
- Local vs. Global amount ratios
- Historical repayment data

##### Model Features
- Advanced preprocessing pipeline
- Two-stage hyperparameter tuning
- SHAP-based feature importance
- Continuous model calibration
- Automated risk factor analysis

### 3. Frontend Platform (`/FrontEnd`)
#### User Interfaces
- Authentication (OAuth/Django)
- Borrower Dashboard
  - Loan application submission
  - Application status tracking
  - Payment management
- Investor Dashboard
  - Bundle browsing and filtering
  - Investment portfolio management
  - Transaction history
